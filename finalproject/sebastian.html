            <p>Haha, yeah, this is Sebastian from Stardew Valley. My sister got me into this game over the summer and it has become my entire personality.
            <p>Sebastian is a freelance programmer, and lives in his mom's basement. DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE ABSOLUTE SAFETY CODE NIGHTMARE HIS ROOM IS WHAT WERE YOU THINKING WHEN YOU BUILT THAT BASEMENT ROBIN?????
                HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY WINDOWS AND NO WINDOW WELL IT'S A FIRE HAZARD!
                <p>*ahem* Sebastian really likes the rain, and you can actually find him outside for once when it's raining! Otherwise bro is just locked in his room on his computer working till late at night when he goes outside to smoke T-T please stop smoking my dude. It's not good for you.
                    You can also find him at all the town festivals, where he is begrudingly there. He is the epitome of being an introvert, and even though he loves his friends, he wants to be alone a lot of the time and doesn't want to go out.
                    As you can tell from his pictures, he is in fact an EMO WOAH- lol but he is very pretty and I love him.
                    In Stardew Valley, you can choose from 12 different characters who you want to marry and stuff, and I initially didn't think I was going to choose Sebastian,
                    until of course, I spoke to him, and then actually said, "GOSH DANG IT (redacted for privacy) I CHOSE SEBASTIAN ANYWAY!"
                    He's kinda just a sad little guy, and I wanna hug him. There may or may not be an ongoing theme with all these characters...
            </p>
