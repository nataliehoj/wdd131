            <p>Fushiguro Megumi, or Megumi Fushiguro if you're an American who doesn't care about how Japan organises names... 
                is a first year student at Jujutsu Tech, a fictional high school, from the story of Jujutsu Kaisen. He's around 15-16 years old, and is totally emotionally repressed. Like dang bro, 
                you good? You know you can show emotion right? RIGHT??? 
            <p>Right, anyway, Megumi grew up without his parents really, and was raised mostly by his half sister, Tsumiki, until about the age of 5
                when a man named Gojo Satoru found him and basically adopted him. Throughout middle school, Megumi got in fights with other kids for seemingly no reason. 
                But, Megumi of course did have a reason, and it was that he hated bad people, those bad people being all the bullies and slackers in the school.
            <p>*sigh* Megumi, you can't just go around hitting people you don't like. it's not nice.
            <p>Fast foward to when Megumi started high school, and his sister Tsumiki slipped into a coma and hasn't woken up since.
