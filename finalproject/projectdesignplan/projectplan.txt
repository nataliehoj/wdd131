site name: Natalie's Favorite Fictional Men
// i chose this because it's just some of my favorite fictional men, because I wanted to make a site that
hopefully motivated me to get it done, and bonus points because it's something i can show my friends lol

the site's purpose is just to showcase my favorite characters.

//the target audience is my friends, so I'll put in maybe some questions I can get from my friends, 
or have them rate the characters XD
