                <p>And I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power⁠, and can do whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger⁠, and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have light while we shall cross the sea.</p>

                <p>And now, my son, this was the ministry unto which ye were called, to declare these glad tidings unto this people, to prepare their minds; or rather that salvation might come unto them, that they may prepare the minds of their children to hear the word at the time of his coming.</p>
